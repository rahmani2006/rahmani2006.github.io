    <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
       is the W3C standard for defining the presen- tation of documents written in HTML,
        and in fact, any XML language. Presentation, again, refers to the way the document
         is displayed or delivered to the user, whether on a computer screen, a cell phone
          display, printed on paper, or read aloud by a screen reader. With style sheets
           handling the pre- sentation, HTML can handle the business of defining document
           structure and meaning, as intended.</p>

      <li>Styles define how to display HTML elements</li>

    <h3>Writing the Syntax</h3>
    <p>A style sheet is made up of one or more style instructions
       (called rules or rule sets) that describe how an element or group of
       elements should be displayed. The first step in learning CSS is to get
        familiar with the parts of a rule. As you’ll see, they’re fairly intuitive
         to follow. Each rule selects an element and declares how it should look.</p>
